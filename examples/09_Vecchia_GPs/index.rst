Vecchia Gaussian Processes
===============================================

Vecchia Gaussian Processes are alternatives to Variational GP's and approximate exact GP's by
assuming that each observation in a dataset only depends on a neighboring set of observations,
inducing sparsity in the precision matrix and enabling much faster training and inference.
